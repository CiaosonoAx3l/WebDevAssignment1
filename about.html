      <h3>About the Website</h3>
      <p>
        This website was created to help students and new builders learn how to design and understand custom Windows PCs.
        The main goal is to provide a friendly and educational way to explore gaming and productivity builds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data used in this project comes from arrays written by me, featuring real life components such as Ryzen 7 7800X3D, RTX 4070, and others...
        Each array simulates compatibility and price calculations using JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design inspiration and structure are based on other web projects developed by me (all of them are on my github).
        The css is generated with tool as cssgridgenerator and using already-existing animations taken by coding.stella.
        I designed the whole site myself starting with a draft of the 3 pages on my tablet's note, create a basic css that works and finally put it in an AI chatbot like Gemini to make the result more visually pleasant.
